    <li>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          Apollos stayed in Corinth to direct and teach
          <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/csb/1co/1/12/p1/s_1063001">BLB</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          Corinth was a port town, Paul went inland [surely preaching along the way]...eventually to Ephesus
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>They didn't know about the Holy Spirit</li>

    <li>John's baptism</li>

    <li>It is possible to repent, to regret, without believing in the sacrifice of Jesus.</li>

    <li></li>

    <li>
      Speaking other languages was a common sign of the Spirit.
      <br/>
      Prophecy is pattern; "giving" prophecy is to speak the Word of God...sometimes an enlightened insight, sometimes a remembrance.
    </li>

    <li>Twelve ~ the number of foundation; i.e. 12 tribes/apostles/etc.</li>

    <li>3 months is a relatively long time for the Jews to tolerate The Way; likely there was some acceptance of the message.</li>

    <li>
      The pattern continues: anti-belief stirred up forcing Paul [and the new disciples] out of the synagogue.
      <br/>
      The lecture hall of Tyrannus; i.e. a school or college.
    </li>

    <li>
      Paul had a long teaching stint and the teachings spread all over Asia [Turkey] from there.
    </li>

    <li> Important to note that it was God doing the miracles. </li>

    <li> 
      It is not unheard of for Yahweh's magic to imbue a physical object.

      <br/>
      These cured diseases and drove out evil spirits.
    </li>

    <li>
      Jewish exorcism was not new.  Here they are invoking Jesus vicariously through Paul- an instantiation God is not obligated to bless.
    </li>

    <li>No surprise a Jewish high-priests sons were operating on the occultic side of Judaism.  Many Jews were/are carnal~ culuturally Jewish rather than true believers.</li>

    <li>
      It is not the norm for divine beings to interact with people verbally, they likely spoke through a possessed person.
      <br/>
      Note that the spirit(s) are not omniscient: they were aware of the big players but not the locals.
    </li>

    <li>A single, divinely "inspired" individual overpowered 7 grown men.</li>

    <li>
      People turn to God when they realize the futility of their efforts apart from Him.
      <br>
      <em>Both</em> Jews and Greeks; i.e. both ethnic and outside peoples.
    </li>

    <li>The new believers gave testimonies of who they truly <em>were</em>.</li>

    <li>
      They destroyed their ties to their old lives [burned the boats].
      <br/>
      They calculated the value of what they gave up- a realization of the enormity of the decision.
      50,000 denaari is the annual salary of thousands of average households.  In today's dollars: many millions of dollars.
    </li>

    <li>In this case The Word prevailed both in the realm of supernatural action and of ideas.  The truth flourished when the old was burned away.</li>

    <hr>

    <li>
      Paul resolved to go to Greece, Jerusalem, and then Rome.
      <br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      He sent Timothy and Erastus to prepare the way.
    </li>

    <li>Naturally, there was disturbance as a preamble to the next movement of the Church.</li>

    <li>Demetrius~ local businessman vested in the local religious establishment.</li>

    <li>Demetrius had enough power to assemble all the craftsmen of his ilk.</li>

    <li>They recognize the debasement of their way of life because Christianity does not require the purchase of physical idols.</li>

    <li>Their foremost priority is the purse-strings; this is couched in concern for their cult of Artemis.  Interesting that they presume all of Asia and the world worship Artemis.</li>

    <li>The Artemaians took a page from the Jewish rabble-rousing book.</li>

    <li>In the riot they drug Paul's companions to city-center.</li>

    <li>Paul may have been spared because he had a reputation in the city.  Further, the disciples shielded him from the fray.</li>

    <li>Paul's worldly friends also warned him away.  Interesting that provincial officials, government bureaucrat types, were among Paul's friends.</li>

    <li>Chaos; most didn't know what was going on, they were just swept up.</li>

    <li>The Jews were pushing to the forefront...</li>

    <li>...but the Greeks wouldn't have.  Note that Yahweh had sent missionaries to unite Jew & Greek; the rabble divides them.</li>

    <li>The official starts with a recount of their traditional station and beliefs: among them the "image...from heaven".</li>

    <li>If these things <em>were</em> undeniable then there wouldn't have been a riot.</li>

    <li>The worldly official recognizes the innocence of the men at the center of the ruckus.</li>

    <li>He is appealing to the rule, and path, of law.  Something that false people typically try to circumvent.</li>

    <li>...</li>
