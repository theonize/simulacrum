  Acts 20

  <ul>
    <li>Paul went to Macedonia, then to Greece; to avoid the plot [against him] he goes back north with an entourage.</li>

    <li>At Troas: Eutychus died and was raised; Paul stayed up all night with the Church- teaching and encouraging.  The journeyed toward Jerusalem.</li>

    <li>The Ephesian elders came to Paul.  He gives what amounts to his last testament.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside>
    <ul>
      <li>1: Gaius & Artistarchus were already there</li>
      <li>2: He traveled north through Asia, then south through Greece</li>
      <li>7,11: He taught as long as people stayed...and they were very hungry for the Word</li>
      <li>9,12: Eutychus died and was resurrected, which comforted/encouraged the local believers</li>
      <li>13-17: Ships typically hugged the coastline to avoid navigational problems.</li>
      <li>13-14: Paul walked while the other sailed to Assos</li>
      <li>15-16: Paul was determined to get to Jerusalem for Pentecost</li>
      <li>26: Paul recognizes and accepts God's forgiveness for his past transgressions.  He is viewing his apostleship as both ministry and penance.</li>
      <li>28: admonition to leaders: "Pay careful attention"; also Jesus "obtained" i.e. ransomed, bought</li>

      <li>29-30: <em>Fierce</em> wolves; i.e. those as adament about their position as Paul is about his.  Not to mention false teachers coming from within the Church.</li>
      <li>33-35: "These hands"~ Paul's hands; the notion that ministers ought to earn their keep.  There is nothing wrong with a congregation supporting a full-time minister but it should not be demanded or put undo pressure on them.</li>
